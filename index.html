			My name is Katie Butterfield and I’m a quantitative sociologist interested in research and teaching opportunities in research methods, food systems, 
			and health disparities. I hold a PhD in sociology from the University of California, Merced, have served as the lead Research Data Analyst for the CalFresh 
			and Nutrition Branch at the California Department of Social Services, and am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the 
			<a href="https://asi.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">Agricultural Sustainability Institute</a> at the University of California, Davis. I have 10+ years of 
			experience in quantitative and mixed-methods research, including work with experts in the fields of sociology, public health, and human ecology. 
			My research program addresses social inequalities throughout our food system by asking how and under what conditions sustainable food programs 
			can improve food access and limit exploitation among disadvantaged populations.
			<br />
			<br />
			I currently serve as a postdoctoral researcher for the Agricultural Sustainability Institute at the University of California, Davis. I explore the 
			limited adoption of more worker and environmentally friendly organic farming practices across California. I work with Dr. Ryan Galt to explore 
			organic production trends across California using public and proprietary data, including the development of a new method for separately tracking 
			organic cropland and animal production within the state. Working with Dr. Galt, and in consultation with <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/" 
			target="_blank">USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)</a> and Dr. Houston Wilson from <a href="https://ucanr.edu/sites/organic/" 
			target="_black">UC ANR Organic Agriculture Institute</a>, I also led the research design and implementation for a study exploring market data 
			needs and pricing decisions within California’s organic agrifood industry, gathering and analyzing data from 227 surveys and 26 interviews 
			on the topic. From these findings, we submitted a report to AMS recommending improvements to their organic market data, drafted a journal 
			article that situates these findings in existing theory, and continue to draft journal articles considering how pricing decisions of 
			organic agrifood actors demonstrate power dynamics in the system and how qualitative data informs decision-making among organic agrifood actors. 
			<br />
			<br /> 
			At the local level, my research on community gardens across the United States highlights strategies for, and barriers to, supporting community 
			gardens as participatory food and health resources in Black, Latinx, working-class, and rural communities. My work can help maximize the overall 
			social equity of local agrifood systems. For example, in “Modeling community garden participation: how locations and frames shape participant demographics” 
			published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-022-10406-2" target="_blank">Agriculture and Human Values</a>, I developed a conceptual model 
			to explain community garden participation as an iterative process of framing, accessibility, and representation, all situated within a garden’s surrounding 
			community. In “Neighborhood Composition and Community Garden Locations: The Effect of Ethnicity, Income, and Education,” published in 
			<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0731121420908902" target="_blank">Sociological Perspectives</a>, I provide crucial quantitative metrics suggesting the 
			diversity of neighborhoods with community gardens and support their inclusion in urban public policy and city planning. In other work co-authored with 
			public health scholar Dr. Susana Ramírez, “Framing Food Access: Do Community Gardens Inadvertently Reproduce Inequality?,” published in 
			<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198120950617" target="_blank">Health Education and Behavior</a>, findings suggest that community gardens may 
			be welcoming toward a diversity of participants but still have room to improve the inclusivity of the framing in their mission statements and goals.
			<br />
			<br /> 
			As the lead Research Data Analyst for the CalFresh and Nutrition Branch at the California Department of Social Services, I directly 
			supported leadership in making data-informed decisions about how best to improve equitable access to healthy food among California’s more vulnerable 
			populations as well as related client outcomes and contractual results. I independently conducted varied research tasks to support data collection 
			and analysis and compiled, analyzed, and interpreted statewide and county data related to CalFresh program areas. I created reports, summaries, and 
			visualizations and communicated findings to department and external stakeholders. To assess program effectiveness, I also monitored trends in CalFresh 
			administrative data and supported the development of complex SQL queries to extract new administrative data measures from one of the largest 
			automated welfare data system in the world.
			<br />
			<br />
			As a graduate student at University of California, Merced, I taught several courses including Introduction to Sociology and Statistics for Sociology. 
			I guided my students through ethnographic and statistical research projects. I presented my work at academic conferences and on-campus workshops aimed 
			at audiences with varying technical and research backgrounds. I was an active member of the 
			<a href="https://www.communicationculturehealth.org/" target="_blank">Communication, Culture, and Health</a> and 
			<a href="https://herutech.com/whitneylpirtle/?page_id=391" target="_blank">Sociology of Health and Equity</a> labs at University of California, 
			Merced. I also served as co-chair of the <a href="https://cec.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">California Economists Collective</a>, 
			and have served on <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/global-food-initiative/systemwide-engagement/healthy-campus-network/index.html" 
			target="_blank">Healthy Campus Network Committee</a>, <a href="https://events.ucmerced.edu/group/sociology_graduate_student_committee" 
			target="_blank">Sociology Graduate Student Committee</a>, and <a href="https://gsa.ucmerced.edu/" 
			target="_blank">Graduate Student Association</a> at UC Merced. My work has been supported by the <a href="https://graduatedivision.ucmerced.edu/financial-support/internal-fellowships/john-and-victoria-elia-fellowship"
