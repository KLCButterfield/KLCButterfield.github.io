				than done” (under review)
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Abstract:
				<br/> 
				Farmers in California have been leaders in organic agricultural production, but the historically growing organic 
				agrifood industry is experiencing declines nationally and in California. To address existing data limitations, we 
				developed a method to examine the relative contribution of crops and animal agriculture to trends in organic 
				production in California. Using data on organic production from the State Organic Program, the USDA Census of 
				Agriculture, and California’s top organic certifier (CCOF), we have developed statewide and county-level estimates 
				of organic cropland and animal production that show a disproportionate growth of organic animal production over 
				time, especially since 2014 and an overall drop in organic cropland acreage share in recent years. We also highlight 
				counties with high overall organic conversion, including Marin, Santa Cruz, and Humboldt. We argue that policy 
				changes are needed to restart the expansion of organic cropland in California to meet state goals of 20% of cropland 
				being organic by 2045, and that improving State Organic Program data is critical for evaluating the success of 
				these policy changes.

				<dd>Butterfield, Katie L., Ryan E. Galt, and Houston Wilson. “The Role of USDA’s Public Price and Volume Data in 
				California’s Organic Food Value Chain” (under review)
				<br/>
				Abstract:
				<br/> 
				For decades, scholars have documented and analyzed a shifting information landscape in the agriculture 
				industry: increasing privatization of information and widespread decreasing reliance on the public sector. 
				Despite the increased privatization of U.S. agricultural information over the past few decades, USDA data 
				releases have remained relevant to the agricultural marketplace and form the foundation of many private 
				sector agricultural market information services. In this paper we use a mixed-methods approach to explore 
				how USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Market News organic price and volume data can be improved 
				to better support organic agrifood system actors. Based on 26 interviews and 227 survey responses from 
				organic producers, processors, distributors, and retailers across California, we show that informal market 
				information sources are the information source most commonly used across the industry. At the same time, 
				we find consistent interest in increased organic market data presented in visual formats with trend 
				explanations. We also identify three main areas where AMS Market News organic price and volume data could 
				be improved: the data interface could be made more accessible and informative; the inaccuracies and 
				gaps in the data should be addressed or, at a minimum, explained; and more specialty crops should be 
				included. Making these changes will help the development of a more robust public source of organic market 
				data that could be especially beneficial for smaller-scale operations, given increasing corporate 
				consolidation in the agrifood system.

				Abstract:
				<br/> 
				Community gardens provide health and stress coping benefits in various geographic settings. However, despite
				the different structural contexts of rural and urban areas, little work has considered how community garden
				health benefits may differ in these contrasting settings. We collected and analyzed in-depth interviews (N = 34)
				with mostly White, middle-class rural and urban community garden organizers across the United States to
				explore understandings of community garden health benefits within these different geographic contexts. Rural
				participants emphasize the holistic community orientation of their gardens, which were simultaneously
				embedded in, strengthening, and reliant upon their surrounding communities. In contrast, urban participants
				emphasize experiences of their gardens as natural spaces and emphasize community gardening as a key driver of
				interacting with nature. While increases in social connectedness and interactions with nature have been shown to
				improve health through promoting stress coping, our comparative approach demonstrates the varying impact
				community gardens can have in rural and urban settings.

				Abstract:
				<br/> 
				The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Market News provides free and unbiased data on prices and volumes of 
				agricultural commodities throughout the United States. In partnership with AMS, this study explores the price and volume 
				data needs of stakeholders in California’s organic agrifood industry. Findings from 26 interviews and 227 surveys with 
				mostly small and mid-sized specialty-crop-focused organic agrifood system stakeholders demonstrate that the use of informal 
				market information is widespread among these stakeholders. Direct use of organic data from AMS Market News and other more 
				formal organic price and volume data sources was less common. We identified specific areas where AMS Market News organic 
				data may be falling short for our research participants: data accuracy and consistency, products and geographies covered by 
				the data, and data presentation and dissemination. Further, organic price and volume data were less often used in pricing 
				decisions than considerations of the ability to cover business expenses, market pressures, and personal experience. Our main 
				recommendations for improving AMS Market News organic data based on these findings are: 1) address data gaps; 2) include 
				additional specialty crops, analyses, and trend explanation; 3) incorporate a simple item-based search process, clearer 
				explanations of terms, and overviews of data collection processes; and 4) improve data visualizations, outreach, and 
				email updates.

				<i>Agriculture and Human Values</i>. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-022-10406-2" target="_blank">doi:10.1007/s10460-022-10406-2</a>) 
				(<a href="Modeling Garden Participation - Accepted Version.pdf" target="_blank">Accepted Version</a>) 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Abstract:
				<br/> 
				Ample research documents the health benefits of community gardens, but our understanding of the factors shaping gardener participation 
				is limited. Neighborhood demographics and garden frames have each been theorized to play a role in shaping who participates in community 
				gardens. Yet, our understanding of the interplay between these factors is underdeveloped and this body of work lacks consideration of the 
				racial and class makeup of gardeners on a large scale. With a nation-wide survey that includes measures of gardener demographics (N = 162), 
				the present study considers the extent to which community garden frames and locations simultaneously shape participant demographics. I 
				combine these factors into a conceptual model explaining community garden participation as an iterative process of framing, accessibility, 
				and representation, all situated within a garden’s surrounding community. Results show some base correlations between gardens focusing on 
				healthy food access or symbolic food labels and gardener demographics, but ordered logistic and negative binomial regressions show stronger 
				evidence of community demographics shaping gardener demographics. At the same time, t-tests comparing mean neighborhood and gardener 
				demographics shows a consistent under-representation of Latinx community members among gardeners. As theorized in the model presented, 
				community garden locations are important for shaping what demographics are represented among gardeners, but how community garden benefits 
				are framed can limit garden accessibility, and subsequently neighborhood representation, especially for Latinx residents. This model helps 
				illustrate the mechanisms through which garden organizers and advocates can develop more inclusive community gardens through fostering 
				representation from people of color and the working-class.

				Abstract: 
				<br/>
				This story map outlines the historical and current context of community gardening in the United States and explores the potential of community gardens to 
				address inequality using national-level survey and interview data of community gardeners, managers, and supporting nonprofits. Community gardens are widely 
				loved for the many benefits they bring. Community gardens have a long history of use by institutional actors to address hunger and as sites of resistance to 
				structural inequality. Over the past few decades, the number of community gardens has grown across the United States, along with other ‘alternative food 
				programs’. Funding for these efforts has expanded, alongside the mainstreaming of discourse around food deserts, food security, and food justice. Broader 
				institutional support has also expanded: a growing nonprofit sector facilitates the growth of community gardens; advocates drive policy changes to support 
				community gardens and urban food growing; academics, authors, and journalists write more about community gardens; and cities have supplied public land for garden 
				use. 
				<br/>
				How are community gardens contributing to their local communities, and how might this increase in community gardens contribute to wider systemic change? 
				To answer these questions, we explore findings from a survey of community gardeners across the United States and interviews with community gardeners and staff 
				at nonprofits supporting community gardens. These findings offer insight into the impact and role of community gardens in effecting change, as well as the growth 
				of nonprofits supporting community gardens today.

				<i>Health Education and Behavior</i>. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198120950617" target="_blank">doi.org/10.1177/1090198120950617</a>) 
				(<a href="Framing Food Access - Accepted Version.pdf" target="_blank">Accepted Version</a>)
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Abstract: 
				<br/>
				<i>Background</i>. Alternative food programs have been proposed as solutions to food insecurity and diet-related health issues. 
				However, some of the most popular programs—farmers markets and community-supported agriculture—overwhelmingly serve White and upper-middle-class 
				individuals, exacerbating food security and health disparities. One explanation for the mismatch is the way in which alternative food programs 
				are framed: Language used to encourage participation may reflect priorities of upper-middle-class and White populations who create and run 
				these programs while lacking resonance with food-insecure populations. This literature, however, lacks consideration of how lower-cost, 
				more participatory programs—community gardens—are framed. We therefore explore the framing of community gardens through a quantitative 
				content analysis of the descriptions, missions, and goals provided by community garden managers across Minnesota (N = 411).
				<br/>
				<i>Results</i>. Six frames were consistently present in the community garden statements: greater good, community orientation, healthy food access, 
				food donation, self-empowerment, and symbolic food labels. Greater good and community orientation were significantly more likely to be 
				used than any other frames.
				<br/>
				<i>Conclusions</i>. Taken together, our findings suggest that community gardens may be welcoming toward a diversity of participants but still have 
				room to improve the inclusivity of their frames. The common use of a community orientation suggests the unique ability of community gardens 
				among alternative food programs to benefit Black, Latino, and working-class populations. However, the most common frame observed was 
				“greater good,” suggesting one mechanism through which community gardens, like other types of alternative food programs, may be reproducing 
				inequality through alienation of food-insecure populations.

				<i>Sociological Perspectives</i>. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0731121420908902" target="_blank">doi.org/10.1177/0731121420908902</a>)

				Abstract:
				<br/> 
				Community gardens provide food, health, and sustainability benefits to surrounding communities. 
				Research demonstrates that low-income or ethnic-minority communities develop gardens to resist divestment and provide access to healthy food, 
				whereas white or highly-educated communities develop gardens to address local sustainability concerns. 
				Missing from this discussion is a comprehensive picture of the relationship between neighborhood composition and community garden locations. 
				Using GrowNYC and GreenThumb’s 2014 survey of New York City community gardens, this study employs negative binomial and spatial 
				regression methods to examine this relationship. Findings reveal increased numbers of gardens in communities with higher aggregate 
				concentrations of: 1. black and/or Latino residents, 2. lower-income residents, and 3. well-educated residents, regardless of ethnicity or income. 
				In keeping with qualitative research on motivations for garden development, this study provides crucial quantitative
				metrics suggesting the diversity of neighborhoods with community gardens and supports their inclusion in urban public policy and city planning.
